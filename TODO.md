# FPL Team Picker - TODO List

## MVP:
- [ ] External prediction integration
  - [ ] Create a web scraping tool from popular FPL blogs
  - [ ] Aggregate it all and put it in a document store
- [ ] Penalise:
  - [ ] players selected from the same team in attacking positions
  - [ ] players playing each other in the same gameweek (e.g don't have a defender of a team if you have a mid/fwd playing them)
- [ ] Save strength info to teams so we can show it in the UI
  - [ ] Validate team strengths e.g arsenal is low?
- [ ] Team information shows 'unknown' a lot
- [ ] Logging: ⚠️ Single-match features detected, generating proper rolling averages...
