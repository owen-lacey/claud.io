# FPL Team Picker - TODO List

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT TO INVESTIGATE**

### Model Validation
- [x] ~~Why are MID/FWDs predicted lower than others?~~ **FIXED:** Double clean sheet calculation bug was inflating GK/DEF predictions by ~2pts
- [ ] Why are predictions consistent across GWs?
- [x] ~~Why is Travers so popular?~~ **IDENTIFIED:** Name matching failure between "Travers" (db) vs "Mark Travers" (historical) causes fallback to season averages instead of recent 0-minute form
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Fix historical data matching** - Use ID mapping instead of names (historical.element â‰  players.id, e.g., Mo Salah: 328â†’381)
- [ ] Can we calculated expected goals conceded instead?
- [ ] Should we estimate expected defensive interactions? We might want to pull from a different data store here
- [ ] Bonus points - are we doing it? Do we want to enable always?
- [ ] Potential: Looking at season total minutes as a threshold for minutes predictions, should we not use % of minutes played in the last few gameweeks?
- [ ] Defensive coding everywhere! I would much rather fail obviously from a data issue. A good example of this is default parameter values.
- [ ] Bring in data from other leagues if we can!
- [ ] Quite a lot of defenders are predicted to score highly?

### Bug Fixes Completed âœ…
- [x] **Clean Sheet Double Calculation:** Fixed duplicate clean sheet points in `_calculate_base_fpl_points()` - defenders/GKs were getting 4pts twice instead of once
