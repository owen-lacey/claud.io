## üí∞ Price Tier Analysis

**Premium Players (10.0+):** Strong correlation (0.896) but severe underestimation (-2.476 bias)
**Mid-tier (7.5-9.9):** Good correlation (0.591) with underestimation (-0.814 bias)
**Budget (5.5-7.4):** Moderate correlation (0.432) with overestimation (+0.499 bias)
**Cheap (<5.5):** Weak correlation (0.424) with severe overestimation (+1.626 bias)

## üîç Key Problem Areas

### 1. **Massive Underestimation of Elite Players**
- **Salah:** Our 4.85 vs FPL 10.44 (-5.59 difference)
- **Luis D√≠az:** Our 3.44 vs FPL 5.55 (-2.11 difference)
- Premium players severely undervalued

### 2. **Severe Overestimation of Budget Defenders**
- **Diop (DEF):** Our 4.38 vs FPL 1.00 (+3.38 difference)
- **Dorgu (DEF):** Our 4.30 vs FPL 0.95 (+3.35 difference)
- Budget defenders massively overvalued

### 3. **Goalkeeper Prediction Issues**
- Systematic overestimation across all price tiers
- Weak correlation suggests fundamental modeling issues

## üìà Root Cause Analysis

### **Why Defenders are Overestimated:**
1. Our clean sheet probabilities may be too optimistic
2. Goals conceded penalties may be underweighted
3. Defensive bonus points may be overestimated

### **Why Premium Players are Underestimated:**
1. Our models may not capture explosive scoring potential
2. Bonus points models may undervalue elite performance
3. Captain effect not considered (premium players are often captained)

### **Why Goalkeepers are Problematic:**
1. Save points calculation may be inaccurate
2. Clean sheet modeling may not align with FPL's methodology
3. Limited sample size for GK-specific features

## üí° Actionable Recommendations

### **Immediate Fixes (High Priority):**

1. **Recalibrate Defensive Clean Sheet Probabilities**
   - Review team goals conceded model
   - Validate against actual clean sheet rates
   - Reduce overoptimistic defensive predictions

2. **Enhance Premium Player Modeling**
   - Add "elite player" features or multipliers
   - Improve bonus points modeling for high performers
   - Consider form momentum for top-tier players

3. **Fix Goalkeeper Prediction Logic**
   - Validate save points calculation (1 point per 3 saves)
   - Review clean sheet probability calculation
   - Compare against actual GK performance patterns

### **Medium-term Improvements:**

4. **Position-Specific Model Tuning**
   - Separate models or calibration factors by position
   - Address systematic biases per position
   - Validate feature importance by position

5. **Price-Tier Aware Modeling**
   - Add price as a feature (expensive players perform better)
   - Implement position-price interaction terms
   - Consider ownership/popularity effects

### **Model Validation Process:**

6. **Regular Cross-Validation**
   - Implement rolling window validation
   - Test against multiple historical seasons
   - Monitor prediction drift over time

## üéØ Success Metrics to Track

- **Target MAE: < 1.0** (currently 1.228)
- **Target Correlation: > 0.6** (currently 0.323) 
- **Target Bias: ¬±0.3** (currently +0.895)
- **Target Excellent Predictions: > 40%** (currently 20.8%)

## üìä Current Model Strengths

‚úÖ **Strong midfielder and forward predictions** - Good foundation to build on
‚úÖ **Consistent performance across gameweeks** - No significant drift
‚úÖ **100% player matching** - Robust data pipeline
‚úÖ **Comprehensive feature set** - Rich input data available

## üö® Critical Actions Required

1. **Immediate:** Fix defensive overestimation (highest impact)
2. **Urgent:** Improve premium player predictions (high value impact)  
3. **Priority:** Goalkeeper model overhaul (lowest correlation)
4. **Strategic:** Implement position-specific calibration

The analysis shows our model has solid foundations but requires significant calibration improvements, particularly for defensive players and premium attackers.
