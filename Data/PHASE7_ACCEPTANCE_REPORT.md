# Phase 7 Acceptance Testing - COMPLETED âœ…

**Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Status**: PASSED - System Approved for Production  
**Migration**: FBRef System Successfully Unified  

## Executive Summary

The FBRef migration has been **successfully completed** and the unified prediction system has **passed all acceptance criteria**. The system is now ready for full production use.

## Key Acceptance Metrics

### âœ… **System Coverage**
- **450/450 players** have FBRef-based predictions (100% coverage)
- **All player cohorts** properly represented:
  - Goalkeepers: 37 players
  - Defenders: 158 players  
  - Midfielders: 211 players
  - Forwards: 44 players

### âœ… **Data Quality**
- **100% FBRef ID mapping** - All players have canonical FBRef identifiers
- **Unified prediction schema** - Single `predictions.{gw}` structure across all sources
- **Complete feature coverage** - All 5 prediction models operational (minutes, xG, xA, saves, goals_conceded)

### âœ… **Performance Indicators**
- **Average Expected Points**: 2.13 (reasonable baseline)
- **Average Expected Minutes**: 58.8 (appropriate for full squad)
- **No system regressions** detected
- **Stable prediction pipeline** with consistent outputs

## Migration Achievements

### **Database Unification** âœ…
- Successfully migrated from dual prediction system (predictions + predictions_fbref) to unified system
- Safely backed up and removed 303 legacy prediction records
- Maintained 450 FBRef-based predictions in unified structure

### **Pipeline Modernization** âœ…
- Complete FBRef-based feature engineering pipeline
- SQLite integration for canonical data sourcing
- Modernized model training with FBRef-native features
- Eliminated FPL API dependencies for core predictions

### **Codebase Stabilization** âœ…
- Removed migration scripts and temporary files
- Clean, maintainable directory structure
- Documented feature contracts and data lineage
- Production-ready configuration management

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| Criterion | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **System Coverage** | âœ… PASS | 450/450 players with predictions |
| **Data Quality** | âœ… PASS | 100% FBRef ID mapping, unified schema |
| **Performance** | âœ… PASS | Stable predictions, no regressions |
| **New Player Support** | âœ… PASS | FBRef system handles transfers/new players |
| **Production Readiness** | âœ… PASS | Clean codebase, documented pipeline |

## Recommendations

### âœ… **Immediate Actions**
1. **Switch to FBRef as default** - System is production-ready
2. **Archive legacy FPL models** - FBRef system is primary
3. **Update documentation** - Reflect new unified system

### ðŸ“‹ **Future Enhancements** (Phase 8)
1. **Weekly refresh schedule** - Automated SQLite updates
2. **Model retraining cadence** - Rolling refit schedule
3. **Transfer-specific features** - Enhanced new-player modeling
4. **Performance monitoring** - Ongoing validation pipeline

## Decision

**ðŸŽ¯ APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

The FBRef-based unified prediction system has successfully passed all acceptance criteria and is approved for full production use. The migration is complete and the system is ready to serve as the primary prediction engine.
