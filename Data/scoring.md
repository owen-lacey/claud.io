## Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Scoring System: 2025/26 Season

The Fantasy Premier League (FPL) scoring system for the 2025/26 season features exciting updates alongside the familiar ways players earn points. Here's a breakdown of how players generally score, with an emphasis on the changes for 25/26.

---
### I. General Point Scoring (Standard for All Players)

* **Playing Time:**
    * Plays up to 60 minutes: **1 point**
    * Plays 60 minutes or more (excluding stoppage time): **2 points**
* **Assists:** **3 points**
    * **New for 25/26:** The definition of a Fantasy assist has been simplified to better recognize player contributions and reduce subjectivity. This could lead to more assists being awarded. This includes the final pass, shots that rebound for a goal (from opposition block, goalkeeper save, or woodwork), and players forcing an own goal. Players earning a penalty or direct free-kick that is subsequently scored also get an assist (unless they are the ones taking and scoring it).
* **Yellow Card:** **-1 point**
* **Red Card:** **-3 points** (includes any points deducted for a prior yellow card)
* **Own Goal:** **-2 points**
* **Penalty Miss:** **-2 points**

### II. Positional Point Scoring

* **Goalkeepers (GKP):**
    * **Goal Scored:** **10 points**
    * **Clean Sheet:** **4 points** (for playing 60+ minutes without conceding)
    * **Saves:** **1 point for every 3 saves**
    * **Penalty Save:** **5 points**
    * **Goals Conceded:** **-1 point for every 2 goals conceded**
* **Defenders (DEF):**
    * **Goal Scored:** **6 points**
    * **Clean Sheet:** **4 points** (for playing 60+ minutes without conceding)
    * **Goals Conceded:** **-1 point for every 2 goals conceded**
    * **New for 25/26 - Defensive Contributions:** **2 points** for accumulating 10 or more clearances, blocks, interceptions, and tackles (CBIT) in a single match.
* **Midfielders (MID):**
    * **Goal Scored:** **5 points**
    * **Clean Sheet:** **1 point** (for playing 60+ minutes without conceding)
    * **New for 25/26 - Defensive Contributions:** **2 points** for accumulating 12 or more clearances, blocks, interceptions, tackles, and ball recoveries (CBIRT) in a single match.
* **Forwards (FWD):**
    * **Goal Scored:** **4 points**
    * **New for 25/26 - Defensive Contributions:** **2 points** for accumulating 12 or more clearances, blocks, interceptions, tackles, and ball recoveries (CBIRT) in a single match.

### III. Bonus Points System (BPS) - Tweaks for 25/26

At the end of each match, the three best-performing players receive bonus points:
* Highest scoring player: **3 points**
* Second highest scoring player: **2 points**
* Third highest scoring player: **1 point**

The BPS uses a range of statistics to create a performance score for every player. Here are the key changes to the BPS for 25/26:

* **Goalkeeper Saves:**
    * **3 points** in BPS if the shot was taken from inside the penalty area.
    * **2 points** in BPS if the shot was taken from outside the box.
    * Penalty saves now result in a minimal reduction from 9 points in BPS to **8**.
* **Goalline Clearances:** Now worth **9 points** in the BPS (up from 3 points last season).
* **Penalty Goals:** A new "Penalty goals scored" metric has been introduced, where a player earns **12 points** in the BPS for scoring a penalty, regardless of their FPL position. (For non-penalty goals, the previous BPS points for each position still apply).
* **Successful Tackles:** Each "Tackle Won" in a match will now be rewarded with **2 BPS points**, simplifying the previous "Successful Tackles (net)" metric.

### Important Notes:

* **Captaincy:** Your chosen **captain's points are doubled** for that Gameweek. If your captain doesn't play, the double points bonus transfers to your vice-captain.
* **Clean Sheet Rule:** A clean sheet is only awarded if a player plays **60 minutes or more** (excluding stoppage time). If a player is substituted off with a clean sheet and their team then concedes, their clean sheet points remain. If a defender or goalkeeper receives a red card, they continue to be penalized for goals conceded by their team.
* **Points Amendments:** Points awarded are subject to change and can be amended up to one hour after the final whistle of the last match of any given day. No adjustments are made once points have been updated on that day.

These changes for the 2025/26 season, particularly the new defensive contribution points, aim to reward a wider range of players for their on-field efforts, making central defenders and defensive midfielders potentially more viable FPL options.
